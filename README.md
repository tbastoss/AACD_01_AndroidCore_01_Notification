# AACD_01_AndroidCore_01_Notification
App to study for AACD (Associate Android Developer Certification). This app is a implementation of the following Android Codelab: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-training-notifications/index.html#0

This app will do:
  - Create an app that sends a notification when the user taps a button in the app.
  - Update the notification from a button in your app, and from an action button that's inside the notification.
  
At the end of this app I've learned:
  - How to create a notification using the notification builder.
  - How to use pending intents to respond to notification actions.
  - How to update or cancel existing notifications.
